Java Conversion Projects Repository
Welcome to my Java Conversion Projects repository! This repository contains projects that were originally implemented in Python and have been converted to Java as part of my learning journey in Java programming.

Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to showcase my efforts in translating Python projects into Java. By doing so, I aim to:
Gain a deeper understanding of Java syntax, conventions, and best practices.
Practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java.
Compare and contrast the implementation details and nuances between Python and Java.

Projects
Here are the projects currently included in this repository:

Hangman Game:

Description: A console-based word-guessing game where the player guesses a hidden word by suggesting letters.
Original Python Version: Link to original Python project (if available)
Java Conversion: Implemented in Java, maintaining similar functionality and structure.
